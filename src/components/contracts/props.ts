/**
 * THE SLOT SHAPES, as types rather than as a convention.
 *
 * Every component below a block takes a FIXED set of named slots and no others. Written as a type
 * alias, a fourth slot is not discouraged - it does not compile, because the alias is the whole
 * shape and there is nowhere to put one.
 *
 * This is the difference between a rule and a fence. `interface XProps { props: XData }` is a
 * rule: correct today, and one `extends` away from carrying a `className` next month.
 * `type XProps = LeafProps<XData>` is a fence.
 */

/**
 * What DATA is: anything a JSON document could hold.
 *
 * A function does not satisfy it, and that is the only thing stopping a component being smuggled
 * through `props` - which is why handlers travel in their own slot rather than beside the data.
 *
 * NOTE FOR AUTHORS: a leaf's data must be declared with `type`, not `interface`. TypeScript gives
 * an implicit index signature to a type alias and not to an interface, so an interface silently
 * fails this constraint. That is not a quirk to work around - it is the constraint doing its job.
